PRACTICALS(6-10)

A brief description of each practical.

6)Adding Foliage, Fire, and Smoke with paint effects.
This practical demonstrates the creation of natural and environmental effects within the Unity game engine. Foliage, such as grass and trees, was implemented using Unity's Terrain tools, allowing for efficient placement and rendering of dense vegetation. üî• For dynamic effects like fire and smoke, Unity's built-in Particle System was used. By manipulating modules such as Emission, Shape, Color over Lifetime, and Renderer, realistic and performant simulations of fire plumes and billowing smoke were achieved, adding life and atmosphere to the scene.

7)Creating water, smoke and sparks with nParticles.
In this exercise, various particle-based effects were developed using the Unity Particle System. To simulate water üíß, particles were configured with gravity and collision properties to mimic fluid dynamics. Smoke effects were created by using soft, transparent particle textures with specific velocity and color-over-lifetime settings to achieve a realistic, dissipating look. Finally, sparks ‚ú® were generated by creating fast-moving, brightly colored particles with short lifespans and collision-enabled trails, showcasing the versatility of Unity's particle tools for a wide range of visual effects.

8)Generating nParticle swams and Bubble masses with expressions.
This practical explored advanced particle simulations in Blender. The goal was to create complex, organic movements like particle swarms and bubble masses. This was achieved using Blender's powerful Particle System in conjunction with Drivers and custom expressions. Instead of relying on standard physics, mathematical expressions were used to directly control particle attributes like velocity and position over time. This method allowed for the creation of coordinated, swirling swarm behaviors and the gentle, rising motion of bubble clusters, demonstrating a procedural approach to complex animation.

9)Simulating Semi-Rigid and Rigid Debris with Python.
This project involved writing a Python script to simulate the behavior of rigid and semi-rigid debris. Using a physics library such as PyBullet or Box2D, a simulation environment was established. In the script, objects were defined with physical properties like mass, friction, and rigidity. The simulation calculated forces, collisions, and resulting motion, demonstrating how rigid bodies maintain their shape upon impact while semi-rigid bodies deform slightly before breaking. This exercise highlights the fundamentals of physics-based simulation and procedural content generation using Python. üêç

10)Motion Tracking with matchmover.
This practical focused on integrating 3D elements into live-action footage using Blender's built-in motion tracking tools. The process began by importing video footage into Blender's Movie Clip Editor. Key features in the footage were tracked across frames to analyze the real-world camera's movement and lens properties. After a successful camera solve, this tracking data was used to create a virtual camera in the 3D viewport that perfectly matched the original footage. üìπ Finally, 3D objects were added to the scene, which rendered seamlessly into the video as if they were present during filming.
